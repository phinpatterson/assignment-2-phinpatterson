# Assignment 2

For this assignment I'd like you to add some CSS to the provided HTML file. You must write your CSS in an external stylehseet and link to it in the HTML. 

In the images folder you'll see two images. This is the goal of your styling attempts. You can get there however you'd like, but that's what the page should look like, layout-wise. You **do not** need the same colors/spacing as those images provide, the main goal is layout. Things need to be roughly arranged the same. You can modify the HTML as you see fit to get things arranged if it helps you with your solution.

Submission will be similar to the last assignment. Push your completed assignment to GitHub, enable GitHub pages, and submit the GitHub Pages link to D2L.
